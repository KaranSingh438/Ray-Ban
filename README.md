# Ray Ban -> Re-Design Landing page

This project is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to create an interactive and visually appealing user experience while leveraging the functionality of SheryJS, a lightweight JavaScript library (or custom tool, depending on what SheryJS is) to enhance the project’s features.

HTML provides the structure of the application, defining the content and layout of the webpage.
CSS styles the webpage, ensuring a polished and modern user interface with responsiveness across devices.
JavaScript brings interactivity to the project, handling dynamic content, user input, and other interactive elements.
SheryJS is used to extend the functionality of the app by providing additional features, animations, or handling complex tasks, making the web experience smoother and more user-friendly.
This project may involve a specific set of interactive components such as forms, buttons, or data visualization elements, all enhanced with JavaScript and SheryJS.
